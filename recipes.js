title: "Honey glazed ham",
description: "The best sweet and tangy glaze for a holiday worthy ham",
ingredients: [
"1 (8-10) pound bone-in, spiral-cut ham, with no added water or juices",
"2 cups packed light brown sugar",
"1 cup honey",
"1/2 cup Dijon mustard",
"2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
"2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar"
],
instructions: [
    "Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 275°F. Line a roasting pan or rimmed baking sheet with 2 sheets of aluminum foil long enough to wrap up and around an 8- to 10-pound ham.",
    "Take the ham out of its wrappings and place it in the pan cut-side down. Fold the foil up and around the ham and seal well. This foil pouch will help keep the ham from drying out in the oven.",
    "Bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the ham not touching bone registers at least 120°F, 2 to 2 1/2 hours total (15 to 20 minutes per pound), checking the temperature after 1 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, place 2 cups packed light brown sugar, 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup Dijon mustard, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, and 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring regularly to break up any lumps. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer until reduced by a third, darkened, and thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat.",
    "When the ham has about 30 minutes left, remove from the oven, uncover, and baste with the warm glaze, working the glaze between the cuts in the ham wherever possible. Return the ham to the oven uncovered. Bake until an instant-read thermomenter inserted into the center of the ham not touching bone registers 120°F to 140°F, about 30 minutes more.",

Top with 2-inch pastry circles, sealing edges firmly together or crimping lightly with a fork to prevent the filling from leaking as they cook. Brush the top of each pie with egg.",
            "Bake mince pies in preheated oven until tops are golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool slightly on wire racks. Dust with remaining 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar just before serving."
